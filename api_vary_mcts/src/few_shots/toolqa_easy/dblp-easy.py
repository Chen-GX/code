## Who are the authors of Some Higher-Degree Lacunary Fractional Splines In The Approximation Of Fractional Differential Equations?
"""Question: Who are the authors of Some Higher-Degree Lacunary Fractional Splines In The Approximation Of Fractional Differential Equations?\n\nThought: To find the authors of a specific paper, one might need to search a database or network that contains scholarly articles and their associated metadata, including authorship information. Given the available tools, the RetrieveScirex tool seems appropriate for retrieving paragraphs from machine learning papers based on keywords, but it may not be straightforward to extract authorship information from paragraphs alone. Instead, the DBLP graph can be utilized to find detailed attribute information about the paper, which is likely to include authors.\n\nAction: LoadGraph\n\nAction Input: {"GraphName": "dblp"}\n\nObservation: DBLP data is loaded, including two graphs: AuthorNet and PaperNet.\n\nThought: Given the correction in the earlier thought process that the AuthorNet and PaperNet graphs are available and the PaperNet would likely contain the detailed author information of the targeted paper we're seeking, we should proceed with attempting to locate the paper within one of these networks. Since the question directly pertains to authorship, PaperNet seems like the most direct approach to find our answer.\n\nAction: NodeCheck\n\nAction Input: {"GraphName": "PaperNet", "Node": "Some Higher-Degree Lacunary Fractional Splines In The Approximation Of Fractional Differential Equations"}\n\nObservation: {'title': 'Some Higher-Degree Lacunary Fractional Splines In The Approximation Of Fractional Differential Equations', 'authors': [{'id': '', 'name': 'Hari Mohan Srivastava', 'org': 'Univ Victoria, Dept Math & Stat, Victoria, BC V8W 3R4, Canada'}, {'id': '', 'name': 'Pshtiwan Othman Mohammed', 'org': 'Univ Sulaimani, Dept Math, Coll Educ, Sulaimani 46001, Kurdistan Regio, Iraq'}, {'id': '', 'name': 'Juan Luis García Guirao', 'org': 'Univ Politecn Cartagena, Dept Matemat Aplicada & Estadist, Campus Muralla, Murcia 30203, Spain'}, {'id': '', 'name': 'Yasser Salah Hamed', 'org': 'Taif Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Coll Sci, POB 11099, At Taif 21944, Saudi Arabia'}], 'year': 2021, 'venue': {'raw': 'SYMMETRY-BASEL'}, 'n_citation': 0, 'keywords': ['FDEs', ' lacunary fractional spline', ' Riemann&#8211', ' Liouville fractional derivative', ' Liouville&#8211', ' Caputo fractional derivative', ' fractional Taylor&#8217', ' s expansion', ' error bounds'], 'doc_type': 'Journal', 'page_start': '422', 'page_end': ''}\n\nThought: Based on the provided observation from the NodeCheck tool, the detailed attribute information for the paper node from the PaperNet graph includes the title, authors with their affiliations, publication year, venue, citations, keywords, document type, and page numbers.

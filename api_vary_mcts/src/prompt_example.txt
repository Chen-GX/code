Observation: We have successfully filtered the data (1 row).

Thought: We then need to know the departure delayed time.

Action: GetValue[DepDelay]

Observation: -7.0

Thought: We then need to know the arrival delayed time.

Action: GetValue[ArrDelay]

Observation: -17.0

Thought: To compute the extra minutes, we need to subtract the departure delayed time from the arrival delayed time.

Action: PythonInterpreter[# solution in Python:
print((-17)-(-7))]

Observation: -10

Thought: After calculation, we know that the answer is -10.

Question: What is the corresponding Mean_IoU score of the FRRN method on Cityscapes dataset for Semantic_Segmentation task?

Thought: The question is asking some performance information about Mean_IoU score of the FRRN method on Cityscapes dataset for Semantic_Segmentation task, we need to retrieve some useful information from the scirex database.

Action: RetrieveScirex[Mean_IoU score of the FRRN method on Cityscapes dataset for Semantic_Segmentation task]

Observation: section : Abstract Semantic image segmentation is an essential component of modern autonomous driving systems , as an accurate understanding of the surrounding scene is crucial to navigation and action planning . Current state - of - the - art approaches in semantic image segmentation rely on pretrained networks that were initially developed for classifying images as a whole . While these networks exhibit outstanding recognition performance ( i.e. , what is visible ? ) , they lack localization accuracy ( i.e. , where precisely is something located ? ) . Therefore , additional processing steps have to be performed in order to obtain pixel - accurate segmentation masks at the full image resolution . To alleviate this problem we propose a novel ResNet - like architecture that exhibits strong localization and recognition performance . We combine multi - scale context with pixel - level accuracy by using two processing streams within our network : One stream carries information at the full image resolution , enabling precise adherence to segment boundaries . The other stream undergoes a sequence of pooling operations to obtain robust features for recognition . The two streams are coupled at the full image resolution using residuals . Without additional processing steps and without pretraining , our approach achieves an intersection - over - union score of 71.8 % on the Cityscapes dataset .

Thought: As the approach achieves an intersection - over - union score of 71.8 % on the Cityscapes dataset, the answer should be 71.8%.
Action: Finish[71.8%]

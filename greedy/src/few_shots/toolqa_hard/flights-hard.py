## What percentage of the flights from TPA were delayed on 2022-01-04?
# 6.9%

"""Question: What percentage of the flights from TPA were delayed on 2022-01-04?\n\nThought: First, we need to identify all flights from TPA on 2022-01-04. Then, we must determine which of these flights were delayed. With these two figures, we can calculate the percentage of flights that were delayed.\n\nAction: LoadDB\n\nAction Input: {"DBName": "flights"}\n\nObservation: We have successfully loaded the flights database, including the following columns: FlightDate, Airline, Origin, Dest, Cancelled, Diverted, CRSDepTime, DepTime, DepDelayMinutes, DepDelay, ArrTime, ArrDelayMinutes, AirTime, Distance, DayOfWeek, IATA_Code_Marketing_Airline, Flight_Number_Marketing_Airline, Flight_Number_Operating_Airline, TaxiIn, CRSArrTime, ArrDelay, DivAirportLandings.\n\nThought: Now that we have access to the flights database and understand its structure, we must filter the records to focus on flights departing from TPA on 2022-01-04. The condition involves targeting flights specifically from the "Origin" column matching "TPA" and the "FlightDate" column matching "2022-01-04"\n\nAction: FilterDB\n\nAction Input: {"condition": "Origin=TPA, FlightDate=2022-01-04"}\n\nObservation: We have successfully filtered the data (218 rows).\n\nThought: With the filtered data for TPA flights on 2022-01-04 obtained, I now need to calculate the total number of flights and the number of those flights that were delayed. "Cancelled" is a likely column which indicates whether a flight was delayed. We will filter the data for delayed flights and then use this information to calculate the percentage.\n\nAction: FilterDB\n\nAction Input: {"condition": "Origin=TPA, FlightDate=2022-01-04, Cancelled=True"}\n\nObservation: We have successfully filtered the data (15 rows).\n\nThought: We observe that there is 15 rows that match these conditions, indicating the number of delayed flights from TPA on 2022-01-04. To calculate the percentage, we need to perform an arithmetic operation to divide the number of delayed flights by the total number of flights from TPA on 2022-01-04, and then multiply by 100.\nAction: PythonInterpreter\nAction Input: {"Python": "# Python code to calculate the percentage of delayed flights (Keep one decimal place).\ntotal_flights = 218  # From previous observation where we had 218 filtered rows.\ndelayed_flights = 15  # From the previously filtered delayed flights.\npercentage_delayed = (delayed_flights / total_flights) * 100 if total_flights > 0 else 0\nprint(f'{round(percentage_delayed, 1)}%')"}\n\nObservation: 6.9%\n\nThought: We have calculated the percentage of delayed flights, which is 6.9%. Now, we can conclude our task by delivering this result with the Finish action.\n\nAction: Finish\n\nAction Input: {"answer": "6.9%"}\n\nObservation: Answer is CORRECT.""",

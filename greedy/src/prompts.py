Please adhere to the guidelines as follows:
1. When solving problem, you should think step by step, where each step includes 3 mini-steps Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation. 
2. If some steps require the use of tools, you should accurately specify the tool names as well as the settings of the parameters.
3. If some step requires accurate calculation, you should write Python code and execute for accurate result.
4. When you discover that a tool has been deprecated and successfully invoke the corresponding new tool for the first time, please use UpdateTool to add a description of the new tool.
5. Upon completing the task, you should call Finish[answer] to return the answer.
6. Please use the following template.

Question: the input question

Thought: the text analysis

Action: the action to take, should be tool_names

Action Input: the parameters of tools, should be in JSON format

Observation: the result of the tool invocation.
